# EP-0001: WebSocket Connection Improvements - Requirements Document

**Status:** Draft  
**Created:** 2025-07-23  
**Phase:** Requirements Definition
**Next Phase:** Design Document

## Executive Summary

This enhancement improves WebSocket connection handling in the SRE AI Agent by implementing automatic reconnection capabilities, connection pooling, and comprehensive error handling to ensure reliable real-time communication between the server and clients during alert processing.

## Problem Statement

Currently, WebSocket connections in the SRE AI Agent are fragile and don't handle network disruptions gracefully. When connections drop due to network issues, clients lose real-time progress updates and must manually refresh their browser to reconnect. This creates a poor user experience during critical alert processing scenarios where continuous monitoring is essential.

**Specific Issues:**
- Connection drops cause complete loss of progress updates
- Users must manually refresh to reconnect
- No indication of connection status to users
- Network interruptions result in lost status information
- High resource usage due to inefficient connection management

## Current State Analysis

The current WebSocket implementation in `app/services/websocket_manager.py` provides basic connection management but has significant limitations:

**What Currently Works:**
- Basic WebSocket connection establishment
- Simple message broadcasting to connected clients
- Connection cleanup on disconnection

**Current Limitations:**
- No automatic reconnection on connection loss
- No connection pooling for efficient resource usage
- Limited error handling and logging
- No connection health monitoring
- No client-side connection state management
- No graceful degradation when connections fail

## Stakeholders

- **Primary Users**: SRE operators monitoring alert processing in real-time
- **Secondary Users**: System administrators managing the platform
- **Technical Teams**: Alert dev UI and backend development teams
- **Business Impact**: Improved reliability of incident response monitoring

## Success Criteria

### Functional Success Criteria
- [ ] WebSocket connections automatically reconnect within 5 seconds of disconnection
- [ ] Users receive clear visual indicators of connection status
- [ ] No manual refresh required to restore real-time updates
- [ ] Connection state is maintained across network interruptions
- [ ] System handles at least 50 concurrent WebSocket connections efficiently

### Non-Functional Success Criteria
- [ ] Connection establishment time reduced by 20% through connection pooling
- [ ] Memory usage for WebSocket connections reduced by 15%
- [ ] 99.9% uptime for WebSocket communication during normal operations
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly and actionable
- [ ] System gracefully handles connection failures without crashing

### Business Success Criteria
- [ ] Reduced user complaints about lost connection during alert processing

- [ ] Reduced support tickets related to WebSocket connection issues

## Functional Requirements

### Core Functionality
- **REQ-1.1**: The system shall automatically attempt to reconnect WebSocket connections when disconnected
- **REQ-1.2**: The system shall use exponential backoff for reconnection attempts (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, max 30s)
- **REQ-1.3**: The system shall maintain connection state across reconnection attempts

### User Interface Requirements
- **REQ-1.4**: The system shall display connection status indicators to users (connected, connecting, disconnected)
- **REQ-1.5**: The system shall show user-friendly error messages when connection issues occur
- **REQ-1.6**: The system shall provide visual feedback during reconnection attempts

### Integration Requirements
- **REQ-1.7**: The system shall integrate with existing alert processing workflow
- **REQ-1.8**: The system shall maintain backward compatibility with existing WebSocket API
- **REQ-1.9**: The system shall support message queuing during temporary disconnections

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Requirements
- **REQ-1.10**: Connection establishment time shall be reduced by 20% compared to current implementation
- **REQ-1.11**: System shall support minimum 50 concurrent WebSocket connections
- **REQ-1.12**: Memory usage for WebSocket connections shall be reduced by 15%

### Security Requirements
- **REQ-1.13**: All WebSocket connections shall maintain existing security measures
- **REQ-1.14**: Connection pooling shall not introduce security vulnerabilities
- **REQ-1.15**: Reconnection attempts shall include proper authentication

### Reliability Requirements
- **REQ-1.16**: System shall achieve 99.9% uptime for WebSocket communication
- **REQ-1.17**: Connection failures shall not cause server crashes or memory leaks
- **REQ-1.18**: System shall recover gracefully from network interruptions

### Usability Requirements
- **REQ-1.19**: Connection status shall be clearly visible to users at all times
- **REQ-1.20**: Error messages shall be actionable and user-friendly
- **REQ-1.21**: No user action required for normal reconnection scenarios

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Must work with existing FastAPI WebSocket implementation
- Must maintain compatibility with current alert dev UI React components
- Must not break existing alert processing functionality

### Business Constraints
- Implementation must be completed within 2 weeks
- No additional external dependencies unless approved
- Must work with current hosting infrastructure

### Assumptions
- Network interruptions are temporary (< 5 minutes)
- Users will have modern browsers supporting WebSocket reconnection
- Current server infrastructure can handle connection pooling

## Out of Scope

- WebSocket message encryption beyond existing implementation
- Support for WebSocket subprotocols
- Integration with external WebSocket services
- Mobile app WebSocket support
- WebSocket load balancing across multiple servers

## Dependencies

- **Internal Dependencies**: Existing WebSocket implementation in `app/services/websocket_manager.py`
- **External Dependencies**: No new external dependencies required
- **Team Dependencies**: Alert dev UI team for client-side implementation

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Items
- **Risk**: Connection pooling might introduce memory leaks
  - **Impact**: Server stability and performance degradation
  - **Mitigation**: Implement comprehensive connection cleanup and monitoring

### Medium-Risk Items
- **Risk**: Automatic reconnection could cause connection storms
  - **Impact**: Server overload during network issues
  - **Mitigation**: Use exponential backoff and connection limits

### Low-Risk Items
- **Risk**: Users might not notice connection status indicators
  - **Impact**: Reduced user experience improvement
  - **Mitigation**: Use prominent visual indicators and user testing

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] WebSocket connections automatically reconnect after network interruption
- [ ] Connection status is clearly displayed to users
- [ ] No manual refresh required to restore functionality
- [ ] Error messages are clear and actionable
- [ ] Connection pooling reduces resource usage

### Non-Functional Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Performance improvement of 20% in connection establishment
- [ ] Memory usage reduction of 15% for WebSocket connections
- [ ] 99.9% uptime achieved during testing period
- [ ] User satisfaction improved based on testing feedback

### Integration Acceptance Criteria
