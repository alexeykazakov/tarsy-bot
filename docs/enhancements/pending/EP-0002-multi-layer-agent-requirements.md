## Executive Summary

This enhancement transforms the current monolithic SRE alert processing system into a multi-layer agent architecture. The new system introduces an orchestrator layer that delegates alert processing to specialized agents based on configurable alert type mappings, starting with a Kubernetes agent for namespace-related alerts.

## Problem Statement

### Current System Limitations

The current SRE AI Agent processes all alerts through a single, monolithic `AlertService` class that handles every type of alert with the same generic approach. This creates several significant limitations:

- **Lack of Specialization**: All alerts are processed using the same generic logic, preventing domain-specific optimizations and expertise
- **Difficult Extensibility**: Adding new alert types requires modifying the core `AlertService` class, violating the open/closed principle
- **Poor Separation of Concerns**: The `AlertService` class is responsible for orchestration, runbook management, AND alert analysis
- **Limited Agent Expertise**: Cannot leverage specialized knowledge for different infrastructure domains (Kubernetes, ArgoCD, databases, etc.)
- **Maintenance Complexity**: All alert processing logic is concentrated in a single service, making it difficult to maintain and test

## Current State Analysis

### Current Implementation Components

The current system consists of:
- **AlertService** (`backend/app/services/alert_service.py`): Monolithic service handling all alert processing
- **LLMManager** (`backend/app/integrations/llm/client.py`): LLM provider management and analysis
- **MCPClient** (`backend/app/integrations/mcp/mcp_client.py`): MCP server integration and tool execution
- **RunbookService** (`backend/app/services/runbook_service.py`): GitHub runbook download functionality
- **WebSocketManager** (`backend/app/services/websocket_manager.py`): Real-time progress updates

### Current Processing Flow

1. Alert submitted via FastAPI endpoint (`/alerts`)
2. `AlertService.process_alert()` orchestrates entire workflow
3. Runbook downloaded from GitHub
4. Available MCP tools discovered
5. Iterative LLM→MCP analysis loop (up to 10 iterations)
6. Final comprehensive analysis generated
7. Results returned with real-time WebSocket updates

### Current Limitations

- **Single Processing Path**: All alerts follow identical processing logic
- **No Alert Type Specialization**: Same tools and prompts used regardless of alert domain
- **Tight Coupling**: Alert orchestration, runbook management, and analysis are tightly coupled
- **Configuration Inflexibility**: Alert types are hardcoded in the supported_alerts list
- **Tool Selection Confusion**: LLM can get confused when presented with too many available tools, leading to suboptimal tool selection as the system scales to include more MCP servers and tools
- **Unorganized MCP Server Access**: All agents currently access the same global set of MCP servers, making it difficult to provide domain-specific tool subsets and leading to irrelevant tool options being presented to the LLM

### What Works Well (To Preserve)

- **Iterative Analysis**: Multi-step LLM→MCP analysis loop provides thorough investigation
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket-based progress reporting works effectively
- **LLM Provider Abstraction**: Unified interface for multiple LLM providers
- **MCP Integration**: Flexible tool discovery and execution system
- **API Design**: Clean REST API with proper error handling

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Requirements

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing API endpoints and data models
- Implementation must use existing Python/FastAPI technology stack
- Cannot modify external MCP server interfaces or LLM provider APIs
- Must preserve existing WebSocket communication patterns

### Assumptions
- Current LLM and MCP integrations will continue to work with specialized agents
- Existing runbook format and structure will remain compatible
- GitHub integration patterns will be reusable across all agent types
- WebSocket progress reporting patterns will scale to multi-agent processing
- MCP servers can be logically grouped by domain (e.g., Kubernetes tools, ArgoCD tools, database tools)
- Agent-specific MCP server subsets will provide sufficient functionality for domain-specific analysis

## Out of Scope

- Implementation of ArgoCD agent (deferred to future enhancement)
- Database persistence of agent configurations (will use file-based configuration)
- Complex rule-based agent selection (will use simple alert type mapping)
- Agent-specific UI customizations (will use existing UI patterns)
- Performance optimizations specific to individual agents (will focus on architectural foundation)
- Multi-tenancy or user-based agent selection (will use global configuration)

## Dependencies

- **Internal Dependencies**: 
  - Existing AlertService refactoring without breaking external interfaces
  - Configuration system extension to support agent registry
  - LLM and MCP integration preservation during refactoring

- **External Dependencies**: 
  - No new external dependencies required
  - Existing GitHub, LLM provider, and MCP server integrations must continue functioning

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Items
- **Risk**: Refactoring AlertService introduces regressions in existing functionality
  - **Impact**: Existing alert processing stops working correctly
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing suite and gradual rollout with feature flags

### Medium-Risk Items
- **Risk**: Performance overhead from orchestration layer affects processing times
  - **Impact**: Slower alert processing and reduced user satisfaction
  - **Mitigation**: Performance benchmarking and optimization during development

- **Risk**: Agent registry configuration becomes too complex for operations teams
  - **Impact**: Difficulty adding new alert types and maintaining system
  - **Mitigation**: Simple mapping design and comprehensive documentation

### Low-Risk Items
