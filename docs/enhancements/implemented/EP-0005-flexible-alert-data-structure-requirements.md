# EP-0005: Flexible Alert Data Structure Support - Requirements Document

**Status:** Implemented
**Created:** 2025-07-28
**Phase:** Requirements Definition
**Next Phase:** Design Document

---

## Executive Summary
Transform the current rigid, Kubernetes-specific alert data model into a flexible, agent-agnostic system that supports diverse alert sources and agent types. This enhancement will enable the system to accept alerts from any monitoring source with minimal validation while allowing agents to intelligently interpret domain-specific data.

## Problem Statement
The current alert processing system uses a rigid, Kubernetes-specific data model that requires all alerts to conform to fixed fields (cluster, namespace, pod, severity, message, etc.). This design limitation prevents the system from supporting diverse alert sources and agent types. As we plan to add more specialized agents (database monitoring, network infrastructure, application performance, etc.), each will require different contextual data fields that don't fit the current Kubernetes-centric schema.

The hardcoded field structure creates several issues:
- New agent types cannot be added without modifying core alert models
- External alert sources must force-fit their data into Kubernetes terminology
- The system lacks scalability for heterogeneous monitoring environments
- Agent development is constrained by pre-defined data schemas

## Desired Improvement
Transform the alert data structure to support flexible, agent-specific JSON payloads with minimal required fields and maximum agent autonomy. The enhancement should:
- **Minimize Required Fields**: Only enforce alert_type (for agent selection) and runbook (for processing guidance) as truly required fields
- **Provide Sensible Defaults**: Apply default values for common fields like severity when missing, rather than requiring them
- **Enable Flexible Data**: Allow alerts to carry any additional contextual data as flexible JSON key-value pairs
- **Agent Autonomy**: Pass all available alert data to agents and let them work with whatever information is provided, making agents resilient to missing or unexpected data
- **Support Agent Diversity**: Enable different agent types to extract and use their domain-specific data fields without system-level constraints
- **Maintain Backward Compatibility**: Ensure existing Kubernetes alerts continue functioning

This "data-agnostic" approach would enable the system to accept alerts from any source with minimal validation, allowing agents to be intelligent about interpreting and working with the data they receive.

## Current State Analysis

### Current Components Involved
- **Alert Model** (`tarsy/models/alert.py`): Defines rigid Kubernetes-specific schema
- **API Models** (`tarsy/models/api_models.py`): Request/response structures for alert processing
- **Alert Service** (`tarsy/services/alert_service.py`): Core alert processing logic
- **Agent System** (`tarsy/agents/`): Current agents expect specific data fields
- **Database Schema**: Current structured tables with fixed columns (will be redesigned for fresh deployment)
- **REST Endpoints**: Current endpoints enforce specific data structures
- **Frontend UIs**: Dashboard and alert-dev-ui expect specific data fields

### Current Flow
1. Alert received via REST API with mandatory Kubernetes fields
2. Validation against rigid schema before processing
3. Storage in structured database columns
4. Agent receives pre-defined data structure
5. UI displays specific fields in fixed layouts

### Current Limitations
- Cannot accept non-Kubernetes alerts without data transformation
- New agent types require core system modifications
- Alert sources must conform to predefined schema
- Limited extensibility for diverse monitoring environments
- Agent development constrained by fixed data expectations

### What Works Well (To Preserve)
- Agent selection mechanism based on alert_type
- Runbook-guided processing workflow
- Reliable alert processing pipeline
- WebSocket-based real-time updates
- Historical alert tracking

## Success Criteria

### Functional Success Criteria
- [ ] System accepts alerts with only alert_type and runbook as required fields
- [ ] Agents can process alerts with varying data structures gracefully
- [ ] Existing Kubernetes alerts continue to function without modification
- [ ] New agent types can be added without modifying core alert models
- [ ] UI components dynamically display available alert data fields

- **REQ-5.4**: Agents shall receive complete alert payload and extract relevant data autonomously
- **REQ-5.5**: System shall maintain agent selection based on alert_type field

### User Interface Requirements
- **REQ-5.6**: Dashboard shall dynamically display all available alert data fields
- **REQ-5.7**: Alert development UI shall support submission of flexible JSON alert payloads
- **REQ-5.8**: UI shall gracefully handle alerts with missing traditional fields

- **REQ-5.14**: Alert processing shall maintain acceptable response times
- **REQ-5.15**: Database operations shall perform efficiently with flexible JSON payloads  
- **REQ-5.16**: System shall handle concurrent alert processing without significant degradation

- **REQ-5.23**: UI shall provide intuitive display of dynamic alert data structures
- **REQ-5.24**: Alert development interface shall offer JSON validation and formatting
- **REQ-5.25**: System shall provide clear error messages for invalid alert submissions

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Fresh database deployment - no existing data migration required
- Must maintain compatibility with existing agent interfaces
- WebSocket message structure may need updates for flexible data
- UI components must adapt to dynamic data structures

### Assumptions
- Fresh database deployment eliminates need for data migration strategies
- Development team has flexibility to modify REST endpoints as needed
- Both dashboard and alert-dev-ui can be updated to support new data structure
- No external systems currently depend on current alert API structure
- Agent developers will adapt agents to handle flexible data gracefully

## Out of Scope
- Support for legacy API endpoints with rigid schema validation (fresh deployment)
- Automatic data transformation from external monitoring systems
- Complex alert data querying beyond basic field filtering
- Backward compatibility with previous database schemas

## Dependencies
- **Internal Dependencies**: Coordination between backend API changes and frontend UI updates
- **External Dependencies**: None - system is self-contained within project boundaries

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Submit Kubernetes alert with current structure - processes successfully
- [ ] Submit database alert with db-specific fields - processes successfully  
- [ ] Submit network alert with infrastructure fields - processes successfully

- [ ] Dashboard displays alerts with varying data structures

### Integration Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] REST API accepts alerts with minimal validation rules
