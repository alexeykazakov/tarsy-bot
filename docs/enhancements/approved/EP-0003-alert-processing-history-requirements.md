**Status:** Approved  
**Created:** 2024-12-19  
**Updated:** 2024-12-19  
**Phase:** Approved Requirements
**Next Phase:** Implementation

## Executive Summary
Introduce an Alert Processing History Service to comprehensively capture and store the complete lifecycle of alert processing, including all LLM and MCP communications, to enable future dashboard development for SRE monitoring and operational insights.

## Problem Statement
Currently, the SRE system processes alerts but does not retain detailed historical data about the processing workflow. This limits our ability to monitor ongoing operations, analyze processing patterns, debug issues, and provide transparency to SRE engineers about alert resolution processes.

## Current State Analysis
The current implementation processes alerts through various agents and integrations but lacks comprehensive data persistence:

**Current Components Involved:**
- `backend/app/services/alert_service.py` - Handles alert processing coordination
- `backend/app/agents/` - Various agents that process alerts
- `backend/app/integrations/llm/client.py` - LLM communication layer
- `backend/app/integrations/mcp/client.py` - MCP server communication
- `backend/app/services/websocket_manager.py` - Real-time updates to frontend

**Current Flow:**
1. Alert received via WebSocket or API
2. Alert processed through appropriate agent
3. LLM and MCP interactions occur during processing
4. Results sent to frontend via WebSocket
5. Processing completes with no historical data retained

**Current Limitations:**
- No persistence of alert processing history
- No audit trail of LLM interactions
- No tracking of MCP tool usage
- No ability to monitor concurrent processing
- No data for performance analysis or debugging
- No operational visibility for SRE engineers

**What Works Well (Preserve):**
- Agent-based processing architecture
- Modular LLM and MCP integration design
- Existing alert processing workflow structure

## Success Criteria

### Functional Success Criteria
- [ ] All alert processing sessions are persistently stored with complete audit trail
- [ ] All LLM interactions (prompts, responses, tool calls) are captured and stored
- [ ] All MCP communications (tool availability, calls, results) are tracked and stored
- [ ] Currently processing alerts can be queried with real-time status updates
- [ ] Historical processed alerts can be retrieved with full processing details
- [ ] Concurrent processing is supported without data corruption

### Non-Functional Success Criteria
- [ ] System supports reasonable concurrent processing without significant performance impact
- [ ] Database abstraction layer allows easy switching providers
- [ ] Data retention policies can be configured and enforced

### Business Success Criteria
- [ ] Foundation established for SRE monitoring dashboard development
- [ ] Debugging capabilities improved through comprehensive audit trails
- [ ] Operational transparency increased for alert processing workflows
- [ ] Data available for performance analysis and optimization

## Functional Requirements

### Core Functionality
- **REQ-3.1**: System shall persist all alert details including metadata, source information, and timestamps
- **REQ-3.2**: System shall capture complete LLM interaction history including prompts, responses, tool lists, and analysis results
- **REQ-3.3**: System shall track all MCP communications including available tools, tool invocations, and results
- **REQ-3.4**: System shall maintain processing status for active alerts (pending, in-progress, completed, failed)
- **REQ-3.5**: System shall provide query interface for retrieving historical and current alert data

### User Interface Requirements
- **REQ-3.6**: Service shall expose REST API endpoints for alert history retrieval
- **REQ-3.7**: API shall support filtering and pagination for large datasets
- **REQ-3.8**: Service shall provide backend integration points for future frontend dashboard development
- **Note**: Frontend UI changes and dashboard development are explicitly out of scope for this EP and will be addressed in a separate enhancement proposal

### Integration Requirements
- **REQ-3.9**: Service shall integrate with minimal impact to existing alert processing workflow
- **REQ-3.10**: Service shall hook into LLM client to capture all interactions automatically
- **REQ-3.11**: Service shall hook into MCP client to capture all tool communications
- **REQ-3.12**: Service shall provide minimal-impact integration with existing agent infrastructure

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Requirements
- **REQ-3.13**: Database write operations shall not significantly impact alert processing performance
- **REQ-3.14**: System shall support reasonable concurrent alert processing without performance degradation
- **REQ-3.15**: Query responses shall be responsive for typical dashboard requests

### Security Requirements
- **REQ-3.16**: Sensitive alert data shall be stored securely with appropriate access controls
- **REQ-3.17**: Database connections shall use encrypted communication where applicable
- **REQ-3.18**: Alert history data shall be protected against unauthorized access

### Reliability Requirements
- **REQ-3.20**: Database failures shall not impact alert processing functionality
- **REQ-3.21**: System shall implement automatic recovery from temporary database connectivity issues

### Usability Requirements
- **REQ-3.22**: Database abstraction layer shall provide intuitive API for common operations
- **REQ-3.23**: Service configuration shall be manageable through environment variables
- **REQ-3.24**: Logging shall provide clear visibility into database operations and errors

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Must use SQLite initially for simplicity and development speed
- Database abstraction must allow future migration to PostgreSQL
- Integration must not break existing alert processing flow
- Must work within current Python/FastAPI backend architecture

### Business Constraints
- Implementation should not delay current development priorities
- Must be developed incrementally without disrupting existing functionality
- Resource usage must remain within acceptable limits for development environment

### Assumptions
- SQLite performance will be adequate for initial development and testing
- Alert processing volume will remain manageable for SQLite in near term
- Dashboard development will follow this foundation service

## Out of Scope
- Frontend UI changes and dashboard development (separate EP required)
- Real-time WebSocket integration for frontend status updates (separate EP)
- Real-time analytics and alerting based on historical data
- Data export functionality for external analysis tools
- Advanced query optimization for large datasets
- Multi-tenant data isolation

## Dependencies
- **Internal Dependencies**: 
  - Existing alert processing infrastructure
  - LLM client integration layer
  - MCP client integration layer
- **External Dependencies**: 
  - SQLite database engine
  - SQLModel or similar ORM for database abstraction

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Can store and retrieve complete alert processing history
- [ ] All LLM and MCP interactions are captured without loss
- [ ] Concurrent alert processing works without data corruption
- [ ] API provides efficient access to historical data
- [ ] Integration does not disrupt existing alert processing flow

### Non-Functional Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] System handles reasonable concurrent processing without significant performance impact
- [ ] Database abstraction allows easy provider switching

### Integration Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Service integrates transparently with existing alert workflow
- [ ] Backend service provides data that can be integrated with WebSocket updates in future EP
- [ ] API endpoints are accessible and return properly formatted data

## Future Considerations
- Migration to PostgreSQL for production scalability
- Real-time dashboard development using stored historical data
- Data archiving and retention policy management
