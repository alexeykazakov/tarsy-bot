# EP-0004: Tarsy Dashboard UI for Alert History - Requirements Document

**Status:** Approved  
**Created:** 2025-07-23  
**Phase:** Requirements Approved
**Next Phase:** Design Document

---

## Executive Summary

Create a standalone Tarsy dashboard (`dashboard/`) for SRE engineers to monitor and analyze alert processing history. This dashboard will be an independent React application separate from the existing alert dev UI (`alert-dev-ui/`), providing comprehensive visibility into historical alert processing workflows, ongoing operations, and detailed timing information for each processing step.

## Problem Statement

With EP-0003 implementing comprehensive alert processing history capture, SRE engineers currently lack a user-friendly interface to:
- Monitor ongoing alert processing operations in real-time
- Analyze historical alert processing patterns and outcomes
- Debug failed or problematic alert processing workflows
- Filter and search through historical alert data efficiently
- Visualize the chronological timeline of LLM and MCP interactions
- View timing information for each processing step and total alert processing duration

The existing alert dev UI serves only as a development/testing interface for submitting alerts and should remain unchanged for that purpose.

## Current State Analysis

### Current Implementation Overview
**EP-0003 Alert Processing History Service** provides:
- Comprehensive database persistence (AlertSession, LLMInteraction, MCPCommunication)
- REST API endpoints with filtering, pagination, and chronological timeline support
- Real-time session status tracking and completion monitoring
- Microsecond-precision timestamp capture for exact chronological ordering

**Available API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/v1/history/sessions` - List sessions with filtering (status, agent_type, alert_type, time ranges)
- `GET /api/v1/history/sessions/{session_id}` - Detailed session with chronological timeline
- `GET /api/v1/history/health` - History service health check

**Current Alert Dev UI (Development/Testing Interface):**
- React 18.2.0 with TypeScript
- Material-UI (MUI) v5.15.0 components and theming
- Axios for HTTP API communication
- Components: AlertForm, ProcessingStatus, ResultDisplay
- Real-time WebSocket updates for alert processing status
- Focused solely on alert submission and immediate results

### Current Limitations
- No dedicated interface for SRE operational monitoring
- No historical data visualization or analysis capabilities
- No filtering or search functionality for past alert processing
- No detailed timeline view of LLM and MCP interactions
- No timing information showing duration of each processing step
- No dedicated interface for troubleshooting failed alerts

### What Works Well (Preserve)
- Proven React + TypeScript + Material-UI technical stack
- Established API communication patterns with Axios
- WebSocket integration for real-time updates
- Responsive design patterns and component structure
- Alert dev UI serves its purpose effectively
